# .deployrc
#
# This is a default user configuration file, located in ~/.deployrc
#
# Settings in this file will override global settings, but per-project
# settings will override those settings found here. Anything you leave
# commented out or unset in this file will use the global configuration.

# Miscellaneous settings
#
# Activate "Smart Commits"; this feature tries to create automatic 
# commit messages by parsing the log files generated during 
# Wordpress updates. Set to exactly "TRUE" to activate.
# SMARTCOMMIT="TRUE"	
#
# If you want to see statistics about your recent git activity,
# set this value to exactly "TRUE"
# GITSTATS="TRUE" 		

# Log settings
#
# Strips the bulk of nasty PHP debug messages out of the 
# log files that are emailed upon deployment.
# NOPHP="TRUE" 
#
# Set the address that should receive your log files
# TO="deploy@emrl.com"
#
# Email log subject line "- project name" is appended to this, creating
# a subject line such as "Project deployed - Project Name"
# SUBJECT="[EMRL] Deployment"		
#
# When should email logs be sent?
# EMAILERROR="TRUE"
# EMAILSUCCESS="TRUE"				
# EMAILQUIT="TRUE"					

# If you want your emails to be sent "clean" (with no detailed logging) set 
# SHORTEMAIL to TRUE. Full logs will still be posted to web logs. Error emails
# will continue to contain full logs.
# SHORTEMAIL="FALSE"	

# Send log file in HTML?
# EMAILHTML="FALSE"

# Integration options
# 
# Set values for where you'd like to post commit messages to 
# via email. You can use something like Zapier to re-post that
# to whatever service you like, or if your project tracker allows
# for input directly via email like ours does, you post directly.
# Some of these options will definitely need to be set in the 
# project's deploy.sh, not in a master configuration.
#
# Email from domain. Whatever you're integrating with may need
# a different From: address than that of the the machine you're 
# actually deploying from.
# FROMDOMAIN="emrl.com"
#
# If you need to specify a user, other than your unix user name
# to be the in the From: email, do it here. Otherwise Leave blank.
# FROMUSER=""
#
# Post commit logs to this email address. This should probably 
# be set per-project. For examples, for oour task management 
# system, this email would be task-####@projects.emrl.com, with 
# the #### being the task identification number for the project 
# being deployed.
# POSTEMAILHEAD="task-"
# POSTEMAILTAIL="@projects.emrl.com"

# General Setup
###############################################################################

# Set the work path. This is the directory where all your
# repos are stored, with no trailing slash
# WORKPATH="{{WORKPATH}}"

# Path to repository configuration files relative to its
# root directory, usually ./config
# CONFIGDIR="{{CONFIGDIR}}"

# Check to see all servers defined (repo host, staging, production, etc) are
# returning a 200OK response
# SERVERCHECK="{{SERVERCHECK}}"

# Running stir as the root user can be dangerous so it is not allowed by
# default. Set to TRUE is really must do this.
# ALLOWROOT="{{ALLOWROOT}}"

# When ACTIVECHECK="TRUE", when running as stir --force --update --quit
# files will be scanned for changes made within the timeframe set in ACTIVETME
# (in minutes) and if any changes are found, deployment will be halted.
# ACTIVECHECK="{{ACTIVECHECK}}"
# CHECKTIME="{{CHECKTIME}}"


###############################################################################
# Git Configuration
###############################################################################

# The URL for your repository hosting, with no trailing slash. For example,
# if you use Github and your repo URL looks like https://github.com/EMRL/stir
# your REPOHOST should be set to https://github.com/EMRL (with no trailing slash)
# REPOHOST="{{REPOHOST}}"

# Activate "Smart Commits"; this feature tries to create automatic
# commit messages by parsing the log files generated during
# Wordpress updates. Set to "TRUE" to activate.
# SMARTCOMMIT="{{SMARTCOMMIT}}"

# If dirty (yet to be committed) files exist in the repo, stir will normally not halt
# execution when running with the --automate flag. If you prefer to have the dirty
# files stashed and proceed with updates set the below value to TRUE. Files will be 
# unstashed after the deployment is complete.
# STASH="{{STASH}}"

# Clean and compress repo before starting up
# GARBAGE="{{GARBAGE}}"


###############################################################################
# Wordpress
###############################################################################

# Wordfence check - Wordfence makes some crappy files that break certain commands
# because of permissions garbage. Setting this to TRUE will enable a check that
# stops deployment if evidence of these files is detected.
# WFCHECK="{{WFCHECK}}"


###############################################################################
# Email
###############################################################################

# Define the path to your mail program, with no trailing slash. As of now, stir
# only works with sendmail/postfix
# MAILPATH="{{MAILPATH}}"

# Set the address the logfiles will be sent to
# TO="{{TO}}"

# Set the address the logfiles will be sent from
# FROM="{{FROM}}"

# Email log subject line "- project name" is appended to this,
# creating a subject line such as "Project deployed - Project Name"
# SUBJECT="{{SUBJECT}}"

# When should email logs be sent? Set to TRUE to activate.
# EMAILERROR="{{EMAILERROR}}"
# EMAILSUCCESS="{{EMAILSUCCESS}}"
# EMAILQUIT="{{EMAILQUIT}}"

# If you want your emails to be sent "clean" (with no detailed logging) set
# this value to TRUE. Full logs will still be posted to web logs. Error emails
# will continue to contain full logs.
# SHORTEMAIL="{{SHORTEMAIL}}"

# Send HTML emails?
# EMAILHTML="{{EMAILHTML}}"

# If you're sending HTML emails, define which template you'd like
# to use. HTML templates are stored in separate folders in
# /etc/stir/html. The value used below should be the folder name
# of your template.
# HTMLTEMPLATE="{{HTMLTEMPLATE}}"

# Integration Emails
# ------------------
# Set values for where you'd like to post commit messages to
# via email. You can use something like Zapier to re-post that
# to whatever service you like, or if your project tracker allows
# for input directly via email like ours does, you post directly.
# Some of these options will definitely need to be set in the
# project's .stir.sh, not in a master configuration.

# Email from domain. Whatever you're integrating with may need
# a different From: address than that of the the machine you're
# actually deploying from.
# FROMDOMAIN="{{FROMDOMAIN}}"

# If you need to specify a user, other than your unix user name
# to be the in the From: email, do it here. Otherwise Leave blank.
# FROMUSER="{{FROMUSER}}"

# Post commit logs to this email address. This should probably
# be set per-project. For examples, for our task management
# system, this email would be task-####@projects.emrl.com, with
# the #### being the task identification number for the project
# being deployed.
# POSTEMAILHEAD="{{POSTEMAILHEAD}}"
# POSTEMAILTAIL="{{POSTEMAILTAIL}}"

# Slack Notifications
###############################################################################

# You'll need to set up an "Incoming Webhook" custom integration on the Slack
# side to get this ready to roll.
# See https://YOURTEAMNAME.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations to get
# going. Once your Slack webhook is setup, run # 'stir --test-slack' to
# test your configuration.
#
# Set POSTTOSLACK to "TRUE" to enable Slack integration.
# POSTTOSLACK="{{POSTTOSLACK}}"

# Add your full Webhook URL below, including https://
# SLACKURL="{{SLACKURL}}"

# Normally only successful deployments are posted to Slack.
# Enable the settings below to post on WARNiNG and/or ERROR.
# SLACKERROR="{{SLACKERROR}}"

# Logging
###############################################################################

# Strips the bulk of nasty PHP debug messages out of the
# log files that are emailed upon deployment.
# NOPHP="{{NOPHP}}"

# If you are not dbugging your stir install, you should probably set TERSE
# to "TRUE", which will keep your log files from including debug information.
# TERSE="{{TERSE}}"

# IF INCOGNITO is set to true, log files as well as verbose output to screen
# will be stripped of details such as email addresses and system file paths.

# are only posting to LOCALHOST.
# REMOTELOG="{{REMOTELOG}}"

# Define the root url where the stir log will be accessible with no
# trailing slash

# DANGER DANGER: If for some reason you absolutely can't use an SSH key you
# can configure your password here

# If you're posting logs to a place on the same machine you're deploying from,
# set POSTTOLOCALHOST to "TRUE" and define the path where you want to store
# the HTML logs.
# LOCALHOSTPOST="{{LOCALHOSTPOST}}"
# LOCALHOSTPATH="{{LOCALHOSTPATH}}"

# Set the number of days before logs should be deleted. Currently this only

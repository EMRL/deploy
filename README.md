`deploy` is designed to speed up, automate, and integrate project deployment. Its main focus is Wordpress websites, but it can be used with any code repository. 

[Changelog](https://github.com/EMRL/deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

This script is in daily use at [EMRL](http://emrl.com), an advertising, design, and development agency in northern California. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

Please note that our documentation here is nearly useless, and there is quite a bit of setup involved in getting this running reliably. A full setup guide is coming soonâ„¢.

## How It Works

Basically, this thing consolidates a boatload of commands into a single command that simplifies web app deployment from a development or staging environment to a production server. 

`deploy` requires [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), and will make use of [`wp-cli`](http://wp-cli.org/), [`grunt`](http://gruntjs.com/), [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/), and  [`mina`](http://nadarei.co/mina/) if they are installed.

## Installation

`deploy` can be run from wherever you've installed it, but if you'd like it to be installed server-wide, follow the instructions below. 

1. In the `deploy` directory, type `sudo ./install/doinst.sh` and enter your sudo password when/if asked
2. That's it. By default `deploy` is installed to `/usr/local/bin/` and support files are installed to `/etc/deploy/`

## Configuration

Configuration is handled globally in the `etc/deploy.conf` file. Individual users also have their own settings in `~/.deployrc`

Repositories can each have their own deploy configuration. An example of this file can be [found here](https://github.com/EMRL/deploy/blob/master/etc/deploy.sh).

## Slack

For workgroups and teams that use it, `deploy` is able to integrate with Slack. You'll need to set up an "Incoming Webhook" custom integration on the Slack side to get this ready to roll. See https://YOURTEAMNAME.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations to get going. Once you think you've got Slack configured, run `deploy --slack-test [project]` to test.

## Autopilot

`deploy --automate` works well for unattended updates of Wordpress sites; great for maintaining updates via a crontab. An example cron script can be [found here](https://github.com/EMRL/deploy/blob/master/etc/cron/deploy.cron.example). Running in this mode, the project will only be deployed if there are Wordpress core or plugin updates. If other code changes are detected the project will not be auto-updated. Smart Commits must be enabled or nothing will be deployed.
